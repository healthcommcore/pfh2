Hi! This is our last week together on the Partnership for Health site. 
I've really enjoyed taking part in the forums and getting to know everyone in the PFH community over the last 10 weeks. 
I hope that you found this site to be fun and helpful, too.<br><br>

Even though I won't be working with you anymore, the site will still be available for you to use for as long as you like. 
No matter where you are with making health changes or quitting smoking, please feel free to come back and read information, 
say hi to others in the forum, and use or revisit the interactive tools and exercises. 
It will all be here for you to review.<br><br>

Thanks so much for letting me be a part of your Partnership for Health experience. 
As a cancer survivor, it means a lot to me to be able to have reached out to the PFH community in such a meaningful way. 
Good luck in the future!<br><br>
