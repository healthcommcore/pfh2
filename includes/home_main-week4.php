            And that's your choice to make.  Lots of people don't want to quit smoking, or aren't ready to. Quitting smoking is a big decision, and for many people, the idea of taking on such a project with all the other things they have to worry about keeps them from trying.<br><br>
            As someone who's survived childhood cancer, you've had to think about and work through many health issues. Chances are, you've had to set goals for yourself in different areas of your life. Partnership for Health can help you think about some <a href="health_manual-1h.php">goals</a> you've set and achieved in the past. Once you have a chance to look at your success in overcoming these obstacles, maybe quitting smoking won't seem like such a big challenge now.<br><br>

            That's great. Quitting smoking is a big decision, and it's definitely a good idea to make sure you're ready for it.<br><br>
            Sometimes all it takes is reminding yourself of all the reasons there are to become smoke-free. Beyond your own health, there's the health of those around you to think of, and a longer, healthier life you can enjoy. The benefits of quitting range from small &#150; like not smelling like smoke &#150; to large, like lowering your risk for another cancer. Maybe it's time to think about your <a href="health_manual-2g.php">reasons for quitting</a> again, to see if your feelings have changed.<br><br>
