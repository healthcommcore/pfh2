            As a survivor, you might have health issues and concerns about late effects of the treatment you received as a child. 
            Late effects are health problems that result from treatments like radiation, chemotherapy, and surgery. 
            For example, radiation kills cancer cells, but it can also damage normal tissue. 
            Chemotherapy can save the life of a child with cancer, 
            but it can also create problems with the way the heart and lungs work. 
            Surgery can also affect a survivor's everyday life.<br><br>
            
            Partnership for Health is here to help you learn more about late effects and how to deal with them. 
            We've also got helpful information about the relationship between smoking and the late effects of cancer treatment. 
            Many survivors don't know that late effects can be made worse by smoking &#150; 
            and that as smokers, they are more likely to get cancers that aren't as treatable as the ones they had as children. 
            By thinking about quitting smoking, you're taking an important step toward a healthier future.<br><br>
