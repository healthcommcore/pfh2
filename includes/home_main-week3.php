As a survivor of childhood cancer, quitting smoking would mean you'd be lowering your risk of developing a new cancer. You'd be creating a healthier environment for your family and friends. And you'd be amazed by all the ways your day-to-day life improves without the taste, smell, and effects of cigarette smoke clouding things.<br><br>
