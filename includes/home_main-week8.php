Hi! We're nearing the end of the Partnership for Health project. 
I hope that you've enjoyed looking over the site and learning health information. 
Remember that if you decide you want to quit and want to use <a href="health_pharmo.php">quit-smoking medications</a>, 
Partnership for Health can provide them free of charge &#150; but only for a few more weeks.<br><br>

Now's also the time to be sure to take advantage of everything the site has to offer. 
You might want to take a look at some pages and activities that you haven't seen before, such as:<br>
<?
$reportCARD=toDoList();
if (count($reportCARD)>2) {
    echo "<ul>\n";
    reset($reportCARD);
    while (list($k,$v)=each($reportCARD)) {
        echo $v;
    }
    echo "</ul><br>\n";
} else {
}
