Hi! We're nearing the end of the Partnership for Health project. 
I hope that you've enjoyed spending time with the Partnership for Health community and learning about health issues. 
Remember that if you decide that you want to quit and want to use <a href="health_pharmo.php">quit-smoking medications</a>, 
Partnership for Health can provide them free of charge &#150; but only if you request them by next week.<br><br>

Now's also the time to be sure to take advantage of everything the site has to offer. 
You might want to take a look at some pages and activities that you haven't seen before, such as:<br>
<?
$reportCARD=toDoList();
if (count($reportCARD)>2) {
    echo "<ul>\n";
    reset($reportCARD);
    while (list($k,$v)=each($reportCARD)) {
        echo $v;
    }
    echo "</ul><br>\n";
} else {
}
