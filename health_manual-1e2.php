<span class="manualHeader">QUITTING SMOKING: WHAT GETS IN YOUR WAY?</span><br><br>

Anyone who smokes and has thought about quitting probably has at least one barrier. A barrier is something that gets in the way of quitting, or can make it harder to even think about it. There are two main kinds of barriers:
<ul>
<li><b>physical or social</b> &#150; you work around smokers, or your spouse or partner is a smoker, for example</li>
<li><b>psychological or emotional</b> &#150;  you use smoking to help you handle stress or depression, or you're afraid you'll gain weight if you quit, for example</li>
</ul>

Take this quiz to help identify what your barriers are. Then learn how you can deal with them, and add your own thoughts and ideas. Click on the answer that corresponds to how much each barrier influences your thoughts about quitting smoking.<br><br>

            One of the things that gets in your way is that you reach for a cigarette when the going gets tough. You might find it hard not to smoke when you're feeling down or stressed out. That's understandable &#150; a lot of smokers are the same way. But it's also something that you can deal with. There are several ways to deal with stress that don't involve smoking:
            <ul>
            <li>You can try <a href="health_tips-relaxation.php">relaxation</a> and deep breathing to help you take a break from a stressful situation. These things actually cause your body to experience some of the same physical feelings you get when you smoke. But they are much better for you!</li>
            <li><a href="health_tips-activity.php">Exercise</a> is a proven stress fighter. People who exercise regularly say that stress tends to bother them less. It also helps your body to release endorphins, which can improve your mood. Exercising every day for 30 minutes is ideal. </li>
            <li>Remind yourself that even though you might feel down or stressed, taking control of your smoking can help you feel better overall. Try some <a href="health_manual-1g2.php">positive thinking</a> to get started.</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="forum/viewforum.php?f=1">forum</a> and talk about your barriers with other PFH members.</li>
            </ul>

            One of the things that's getting in your way is that you simply like to smoke. You're not alone &#150; lots of smokers say the same thing about it. But many people also find that as they get older, they become more dependent on smoking. They find that it affects their health in pretty negative ways, and they end up liking it less and less. <br><br>
            Think about how smoking fits into your life, and whether or not it could affect your ability to reach certain goals you have for yourself. Will it be <a href="news_cost-benefits.php">worth it</a>? What sorts of things could you <a href="health_manual-1e.php">gain</a>?<br><br>
            Try going to the <a href="forum/viewforum.php?f=1">forum</a> and talking about your barriers with other PFH members.<br><br><br>

            Many smokers believe that smoking helps them manage their weight. But the reality is that only about one in three smokers gain weight after they quit. And of those who do gain weight, the average weight gain is only about 5 pounds. Here are some tips to think about if worries about weight gain are a barrier to quitting smoking:
            <ul>
            <li>Start <a href="health_tips-activity.php">exercising</a> before you quit smoking. If you already exercise, try to do a little bit more. Exercise is a triple threat: it burns calories, helps you manage stress, and lessens the urge to smoke.</li>
            <li>If snacking helps you control your urge to light up, plan ahead by getting low-calorie <a href="health_tips-weight2.php">snacks</a> like carrots, celery, and apples. Lean protein like low-fat cheese or yogurt can also be good. Try to avoid too many high-fat and sugary foods.</li>
            <li>There are many good strategies for managing smoking urges that don't involve food. Drinking water, deep breathing, and using <a href="health_tips-relaxation.php">relaxation techniques</a> can go a long way toward warding off cravings for cigarettes.</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="forum/viewforum.php?f=1">forum</a> and talk about your barriers with other PFH members.</li>
            </ul>

            Many smokers with good intentions feel like they just don't know how to quit. Although it's not always easy, there are a lot of ways to make it more manageable. Start by trying the following:
            <ul>
            <li>Learn about <a href="health_pharmo.php">quit-smoking medications</a>. They are proven to help smokers quit, and Partnership for Health can get them for you at no charge.</li>
            <li>Take some very <a href="health_manual-1f.php">small steps</a> to see what life would be like as a nonsmoker.</li>
            <li>Think about the types of situations that make you want to smoke &#150; the <a href="health_manual-2e.php">whens, wheres, and whys</a> of your smoking. This will help get you thinking about how to prepare and plan to do things instead of smoking.</li>
            </ul>

            One of your barriers is that you've already decided that you can't do it. But just because you tried to quit once (or even several times), that doesn't mean that you can never succeed! It often takes smokers many tries to kick the habit for good. Here are some things to think about:
            <ul>
            <li>Remind yourself that not everyone succeeds at everything the very first time.</li>
            <li>Look at the differences between the last time you tried to quit and now. Maybe the time or situation wasn't right for you. Has anything changed that might make it easier this time? </li>
            <li>If you're really motivated to quit and you're well-prepared, this time it will work. Break down the quitting process into manageable parts, and take it one day at a time.</li>
            <li>Make a list of three friends who have made a healthy change after trying several times. Ask them for tips and support.</li>
            <li>Draw on past experiences where you've made <a href="health_manual-1h.php">positive changes</a>. If you remember other victories, it boosts your confidence.</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="forum/viewforum.php?f=1">forum</a> and talk about your barriers with other PFH members.</li>
            </ul>

            Living with a smoker or having close friends or co-workers who smoke can be really hard, especially if you're looking to quit smoking and they aren't. But there are ways to work around barriers like these:
            <ul>
            <li>Others may not know that you're a childhood cancer survivor, and even if they do, they may not know that smoking is more dangerous for you than it is for them. Make sure they understand.</li>
            <li>Talk with the smokers you know, and try to work something out. Ask them to limit their smoking to one area or to smoke outside. Ask that they empty ashtrays and not leave cigarettes and lighters around. </li>
            <li>Identify what <a href="health_tips-socialSupport.php">friends and family</a> can do to actively help you quit smoking. </li>
            <li>Think about the <a href="health_manual-4b2.php">people and places</a> that will be challenging for you, so you can plan ahead of time.</li>
            <li>Make a list of three friends who have made a healthy change after trying several times. Ask them for tips and support.</li>
            <li>Go to the <a href="forum/viewforum.php?f=1">forum</a> and talk about your barriers with other PFH members.</li>
