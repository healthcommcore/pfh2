<div style="padding-right:15px;">
It looks like you have a low level of dependence on nicotine.
<img src="images/flash/dependentScale<?=$HTTP_GET_VARS["levelB"]?>.gif" width=265 height=175 border=0 alt=""><br><br>
This means that you might not be addicted to cigarettes. But that doesn't mean that you don't feel a little dependent on them &#150; addiction can be both physical and psychological.<br><br>
It may seem logical that only a few cigarettes once in a while can't do much harm, but there really is no such thing as a safe number of cigarettes. Studies show that it's the overall length of time that someone smokes that harms the body, more than the number of cigarettes smoked each day. And light or occasional smokers often become addicted to nicotine eventually. You may want to think about quitting, while you still have the choice. In other words, quitting would be much easier for you than for a heavier smoker, because you wouldn't have to deal with withdrawing from nicotine.<br><br>
For you, the psychological aspects seem to be what keep you smoking. Although there are effective <a href="health_pharmo.php">medications</a> that help people quit smoking, you might find it's more helpful to think about the things and feelings that keep you smoking. A lot of light smokers say they smoke because of:
<ul>
<li>stress</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>depression or the blahs</li>
<li>worry about weight gain</li>
</ul>

This may mean that you are physically <i>or</i> psychologically addicted to cigarettes &#150; or perhaps a bit of both. <br><br>
