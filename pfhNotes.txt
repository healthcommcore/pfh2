OLD AD SWAP-OUT
  - could Adam go through the ads list, and say: for every out-dated ad, here is what I intended to replace it?
  
NEW-FORUM-MESSAGE AD
  - the one up there right now was only put there as a placeholder

SHOULD THERE BE LINKS IN HERE (about us copy)  
  - Partnership for Health is a project of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital, Princess Margaret Hospital, and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Funding has been provided by the National Cancer Institute.

FROM FAQ (needs re-labeling / linkage)

HELP PAGE
  - need to refine/replace rollover effect

SHOULD THERE BE LINKS HERE (about you homepage)
  - keep a private journal... think about the things you like and don't like... think about when, where, and why you smoke

"IMPORTANT" QUALIFIER CONFUSES PEOPLE
  - ...indicate how much you agree with each sentence (I'm embarrassed to have to smoke: not important, slightly important, moderately important, etc)

REFERENCE STYLE

"YOUR PAGES" - empty
  - what would this page have at first? / over time?

YOUR JOURNAL PAST-ENTRIES
  - right-hand nav breaks out of style
  - same for thank-you-for-new-submission page

MAIN NEWS-ARCHIVE STORY not in side-nav
  - "SECONDARY CANCERS IN SURVIVORS"
  
YOUR MONEY / YOUR LIFE
  - how much do you spend... validation doesn't limit migh amounts

WHAT YOU'RE SMOKING
  - answer popup should RE-state Question number
  - HealthForums off-site link showed: "PAGE NOT FOUND"

RESOURCES: CLINICS
  - long links don't wrap well
RESOURCES: WEBSITES

SUCCESS STORIES
  - no Rich copy
  - Next/Prev nav too close to copy on "Marty"
  - only 1 ad on "Marty"
  
ON YOUR MIND
  - many ????
  
MEDICAL EXPERTS
  - should this have some intro copy, saying why these people are affiliated with THIS project - are they available for questions, etc??

PATCH/ZYBAN
  - should top of page(s) contain jump links (a la FAQ)?

COMMUNITY / ARE YOU DEPENDENT?
  - doesn't "remember" your results for return visits

GREEN BAR
  - if you're on BODYGUY, and green bar content would normally CALL OUT BodyGuy, should there some logical override?

HEALTHY TIPS
  - homepage needs new organization
  - image has wacky alingment in "Help from Friends and Family"
  - PAGE TITLE GRAPHICS: 2nd Smoke, Breakfast, Nutrition Label, Supermarket Shopping, Multivitamins, Serving Size
  - for NUTRITION SECTION... pages of short copy, but with continuation or association of topical content, lose the nav for that WAY DOWN the right hand side of the page
